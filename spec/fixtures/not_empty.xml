Few studies have addressed how density-dependent and density-independent regulation of population growth and abundance varies among habitats for a species that requires multiple habitat types to complete its life cycle. Understanding such relationships, however, are of direct relevance to the control of crop pest insects that regularly move between crop and non-crop habitats. 2. We used autoregressive models to analyse a series of seasonal catches of the cereal aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. The data were collected from regional suction traps and egg counts on the overwintering host, over a period of 14-31 years, at four locations in Sweden. R. padi is an obligate host-alternating species in Sweden and seasonal catches reflect habitat use in a year: the primary woody host in winter and spring, the cereal crops in summer, and the perennial grasslands in the autumn. 3. Strong direct density dependence acting within the year was found, but the strength varied between seasons depending on habitat use by the aphids during the year. Only a weak indication or no indication at all of density dependence was found during the period of residency on the primary host in the winter and spring periods. 4. Density dependence occurred when R. padi utilized summer cereals (42% of the variation was explained), and even stronger density dependence occurred in the perennial grasslands in the autumn (70% variation explained). Stochastic fluctuations in the winter and spring were balanced by a strong density dependence in the cereal and grassland habitats in the summer and autumn periods, which reduced variability in population fluctuations. 5. Weather, measured as seasonal average temperature and accumulated precipitation, did not affect aphid abundance fluctuations much, explaining only 1-9% of the variability. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that density-dependent regulation of R. padi occurs in late summer grasslands and early summer cereals. The mechanisms causing these patterns are not understood, making it difficult to provide specific pest management recommendations at this stage. The results do indicate, however, that pest management needs to involve a landscape-level approach, taking into account mechanistic information about the plant, herbivore and predator interactions in multiple habitats visited by the herbivorous pest.</abstract></record><record><database name="nomes_dos_articles.enl" path="nomes_dos_articles.enl">nomes_dos_articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brabec, Marek</author><author>Honěk, Alois</author><author>Pekár, Stano</author><author>Martinková, Zdenka</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Population dynamics of aphids on cereals: Digging in the time-series data to reveal population regulation caused by temperature</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25184219</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0106228</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Brabec et al. - 2014 - Population dynamics of aphids on cereals Digging in the time-series data to reveal population regulation caused b.PDF</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>53;context: population dynamics;context: variabilitat interannual;context: variables ambientals;country: Czech Republic;crop: cereal;crop:wheat;especie: Metopolophium dirhodum;especie: Rhopalosiphon padi;especie: Sitobion avenae;estadística: time series;organisme: afids;type of study: experiment</label><abstract>Aphid populations show periodic fluctuations and many causes are attributed to their dynamic. We investigated the regulation by temperature of the aphid populations composed of Metopolophium dirhodum, Sitobion avenae, and Rhopalosiphum padi on winter wheat using a 24 years long time series data. We computed the sum of daily temperatures above 5°C, the threshold temperature for aphid development, and the sum of daily temperatures within the [0(threshold for wheat development),5] °C interval. Applying Generalised Additive Model framework we tested influences of temperature history expressed via degree days before the start of the aphid immigration on the length of their occurrence. We aimed to estimate the magnitude and direction of this influence, and how far to the past before the start of the aphid season the temperature effect goes and then identify processes responsible for the effect. We fitted four models that differed in the way of correcting for abundance in the previous year and in specification of temperature effects. Abundance in the previous year did not affect the length of period of aphid population growth on wheat. The temperature effect on the period length increased up to 123 days before the start of the current season, i.e. when wheat completed vernalization. Increased sum of daily temperatures above 5°C and the sum of daily temperatures within the [0,5] °C interval both shortened the length of period of aphid population growth. Stronger effect of the latter suggests that wheat can escape from aphid attacks if during winter temperatures range from 0 to 5°C. The temperature influence was not homogeneous in time. The strongest effect of past temperature was about 50 to 80 and 90 to 110 days before the beginning of the current aphid season indicating important role of termination of aphid egg dormancy and egg hatching.</abstract></record></records></xml>
